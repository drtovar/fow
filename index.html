LA 8111: Forms of Writing II<br>
SCI-Arc: Spring 2025<br>
Instructor: Daniel Tovar (contact via Teams)<br>
TA: Nicholas MacIntyre (contact via Teams)<br>
Time: Tuesday, 1:00–3:50 PM<br>
Room: 160</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Course Description</strong></p>
<p dir="auto">Forms of Writing II is a writing composition class with an emphasis on expository and argumentative writing. Through short in-class writing assignments and three longer essays, students will become familiar with concepts fundamental to academic writing: identifying and formulating a thesis; understanding the essay as putting forward a claim, supported by reasons and evidence; approaching their own written work as a reader, not a writer; and proper citation and bibliographic formats.</p>
<p dir="auto">The class will achieve these goals through three essays. In the first essay, students will provide an analysis of another’s argument, giving them practice in identifying a thesis and the premises backing that thesis up. In the second essay, students will give an extended analysis of a short film. This will provide students the opportunity to come up with their own thesis—in the form of an interpretation of the work—and a sustained argument defending that interpretation. Finally, in the third essay students will conduct research on a particular place, developing a claim about that place. In all three writing assignments students will practice outlining, drafting, and citing their work as described by one of the major style guides (MLA, APA, Chicago).</p>

</ul>
<p dir="auto">**</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Course Requirements &amp; Expectations</strong></p>
<ol>
<li dir="auto">Students should come to class having done the reading and writing due on that day. All students should bring printed copies of the readings to class and be prepared to write about and discuss them. Students should bring a pencil and paper to write on.</li>
<li dir="auto">Class attendance is mandatory. In accordance with the SCI-Arc student handbook, more than three absences will result in a failing grade. Being late to class 20 minutes or more will count as an absence. Note that while being consistently under 20 minutes late will not result in an absence, it can significantly affect your participation grade.</li>
<li dir="auto">Participation in class is mandatory. All students will be expected to participate in class discussions, group work, in-class writing exercises etc.&nbsp;</li>
<li dir="auto">All assignments should be turned in by the assigned due date. The final paper and journal entries <strong>cannot</strong> be turned in late. In extraordinary circumstances (e.g. because of extenuating medical concerns) extensions may be granted. Students must request an extension prior to the assignment’s due date.</li>
<li dir="auto">A note on technology in the classroom: All phones must be put away, out of sight during class. I highly recommend that you do not take notes on a computer. Nevertheless, if that is your preference, I will allow it. However, I reserve the right to ban all computers if I find a student working on other work during class time.</li>
<li dir="auto">This class will not be broadcast over zoom or recorded. Just like it was in the old days, if you cannot come to class in person, you will have to miss the class. Ask your classmates for notes, make sure you do the reading.</li>
<li dir="auto">Any work found to be plagiarized—including work that has been written using chatGPT—will receive no credit and the offending student may be asked to leave the course.</li>
</ol>
<p dir="auto">**</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Course Evaluation</strong></p>
<p dir="auto">Your grade is based on:&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li dir="auto">Journal entries and assignment drafts (20%)</li>
<li dir="auto">Participation (includes participation in class discussion, in-class writing exercises, and group work) (15%)</li>
<li dir="auto">Final Essay Assignment 1 (20%)</li>
<li dir="auto">Final Essay Assignment 2 (20%)</li>
<li dir="auto">Final Essay Assignment 3 (25%)</li>
</ol>
<p dir="auto">**</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Assignments: Kinds, Descriptions, Expectations</strong></p>
<p dir="auto"><em>1. Journal Entries</em></p>
<p dir="auto">Throughout the semester you will have to write journal entries, typically in class. These are informal writing exercises. That is to say, they do not require you to write a proper introduction or conclusion (unless explicitly specified) and they don’t require you to cite your work (again, unless explicitly specified). They do require you to write with grammatical sentences, organized into paragraphs. As the name suggests, these should be thought of as journal entries and are opportunities for you to practice writing, usually focusing on a particular skill (although not always). These are graded pass/no pass. A pass requires you to complete all aspects of the assignment with a good faith effort.</p>
<p dir="auto"><em>2. Essays</em></p>
<p dir="auto">Essays are formal writing assignments. As such, they should have proper introductions and conclusions, the body of the writing should be organized into paragraphs that develop an argument, and the writing should be properly cited (In class, we will discuss what this means). These assignments are graded on a scale from 0–100.</p>
<p dir="auto"><em>3. Peer Review</em></p>
<p dir="auto">In peer review you are expected to carefully read a partner’s work and make thoughtful, considered comments on that work. As the semester progresses, we will talk more about how to do a peer review.</p>
<p dir="auto">**</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Grading Procedures</strong></p>
<p dir="auto">Grades will be determined based upon the quality of work produced, improvement over the course of the semester, completion of project requirements, quality of participation, attendance, attitude and ethical conduct. SCI-Arc grading policies will be discussed on the first day of class, and any questions regarding grades or policies should be directed to the instructor and/or Lisa Russo, the registrar. A passing grade in the course requires completion of all assignments. Incomplete work will not be evaluated.</p>
<p dir="auto">**</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Grading</strong></p>
<p dir="auto">SCI-Arc employs a narrative grading system, as follows: credit with distinction (CR+), credit (CR), marginal credit (CR-), conditional credit (CCR), no credit (NC), incomplete (I) and withdrawal (W). The grade of no credit (NC) is given whenever cumulative work, final work, and/or attendance are unsatisfactory. It is also given when a student fails to submit a final project or fails to take a final examination without prior approval from the instructor. No credit (NC) grades cannot be altered.</p>

<p dir="auto">**</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Academic Integrity Policy</strong></p>
<p dir="auto">SCI-Arc believes strongly in the integrity of the work of individuals. Student work that presents the ideas or words of others as the student’s own adversely impacts the whole school and may lead to immediate dismissal. Academic dishonesty, including cheating, plagiarism, commissioning academic work by others, or performing academic work on behalf of another student, is strictly prohibited. It is the student’s duty to be familiar with what plagiarism is and how to avoid it.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="auto">Special Note: the use of Chat GPT or other artificial intelligence software to write papers for this class, in whole or in part, shall count as an act of plagiarism.</p>
<p dir="auto">Anyone found to be submitting plagiarized work will immediately be dropped from the course with a grade of No Credit.</p>
<p dir="auto">**</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Attendance Policy (from SCI-Arc Student Handbook)</strong></p>
<p dir="auto">Any student who is absent without an acceptable excuse more than three times during a fifteen-week term will automatically receive a grade of no credit (NC) for the course. Instructors may impose more&nbsp; stringent attendance requirements and should make them clear at the beginning of the term. It is legitimate for the instructor to view unexcused lateness or departures from class as full absences.</p>
<p dir="auto">**</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Incomplete Work</strong></p>
<p dir="auto">A student may receive a grade of incomplete (I) by requesting permission from the instructor prior to the date of the final examination or presentation. Permission will be granted only under extraordinary circumstances and usually for medical reasons. Incompletes must be fulfilled to the satisfaction of the instructor no later than six weeks after the end of term. The student is responsible for providing the instructor with the “Request for Credit” card used for this purpose. This card must be signed by the instructor and returned to the Registrar’s office. Failure to do so will result in the incomplete (I) being changed to a no credit (NC). No credit grades cannot be altered.</p>
<p dir="auto">**</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Appeal of a Grade</strong></p>
<p dir="auto">Evaluation of a student’s performance in each course is the responsibility of the instructor for that course. If the grade is disputed, a student may appeal to the instructor for a review. If, after the review, the student still believes that a grade has been assigned unfairly, the student may submit a written petition with a copy of the transcript and portfolio, if necessary, to the Academic Counselor and a committee of the program directors and faculty will review the work. The petition must clearly state the reasons for the appeal. Petitions must be settled and a final grade submitted to the registrar no later than three weeks after the end of the term in which the course was completed. The program director’s decision concerning such an appeal is final.</p>
<p dir="auto">**</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Ownership of Student Work (from SCI-Arc Student Handbook)</strong></p>
<p dir="auto">Physical copies of student work submitted to the school to satisfy course requirements including, but not limited to digital files, papers, drawings, and models—become the property of the school. SCI-Arc assumes no obligation to safeguard such materials and may, at its discretion, retain them, return them to the student, or discard them.</p>
<p dir="auto">Notwithstanding whether it retains the physical copies of such student works, SCI-Arc shall have a non-revocable royalty-free, worldwide right in perpetuity to use, reproduce, display and exhibit works created by students in the course of their studies at SCI-Arc in publications about</p>
<p dir="auto">SCI-Arc, on its website, and otherwise, and shall have the sole right to publish or display work in collections which include other SCI-Arc students, without compensation to the student. The student shall have the right to publish or display the work he/she creates in the course of his/her studies at SCI-Arc in collections of only his/her own work. SCI-Arc and the student will have&nbsp; joint ownership of the intellectual property embodied in the works created by the student in the course of his/her studies at SCI-Arc, and except as limited above, each shall have the right to exploit such intellectual property without accounting to, or compensating the other.</p>
<p dir="auto">**</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Archiving</strong></p>
<p dir="auto">Selected students may be required to submit physical examples of their work or digital examples, no later than one week after the end of term, to their instructors or administration for archiving and, at SCI-Arc’s election, posting on the SCI-Arc website. By enrolling at SCI-Arc, each student grants SCI-Arc a license to reproduce and display his or her work. This is a chance for students to have their work shown online and potentially featured in forthcoming school publications.</p></p>
